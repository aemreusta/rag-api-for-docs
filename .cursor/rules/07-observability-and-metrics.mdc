# Observability & Metrics

- **Structured Logging**: Use the configured logger from `app/core/logging_config.py`.
- **Context**: Include request IDs, user/context IDs, and operation names in logs when available.
- **Levels**: Use `debug` for dev detail, `info` for key lifecycle events, `warning` for recoverable issues, `error` for failures.
- **Metrics**: For I/O, retries, or background jobs, emit counters and histograms using `app/core/metrics.py`.
- **PII**: Never log secrets or personally identifiable information.
