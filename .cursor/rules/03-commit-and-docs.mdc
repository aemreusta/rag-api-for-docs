### Conventional Commits
When asked for a commit message, you MUST use the **Conventional Commits** specification.
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Example: `feat(api): add endpoint for chat query processing`
- Scope should be a specific part of the app, e.g., `api`, `core`, `db`, `schemas`, `scripts`.

### Documentation
- If you change a significant piece of logic, suggest updating the relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory.
- For architectural changes, mention that a Mermaid diagram (`.mmd`) in `docs/diagrams/` may need to be updated.
