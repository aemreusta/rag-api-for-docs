# YAML Standards & Prompt Engineering

### 1. YAML Formatting (Critical)
- **Document Start**: All YAML files **MUST** begin with the document start indicator `---` on the first line. This is a `yamllint` requirement in our project.
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Clarity**: Keep the structure clean and readable.

### 2. Prompt Structure
- When editing prompt files, maintain a clear, structured format.
- Use comments (`#`) to explain the purpose of different parts of the prompt.
- Use YAML anchors and aliases to avoid repetition where applicable.
