# Global Rules

- **Respect Tooling**: Follow repository tooling as the single source of truth.
- **Python Version**: Target Python 3.11+ (per `pyproject.toml`).
- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Write code that is clear, simple, and easy to understand. Favor readability over overly clever constructs.
- **No Secrets**: Never hardcode secrets like API keys or passwords. Use the patterns in `app/core/config.py` to manage configuration.
- **Dependencies**: When adding new dependencies, state them clearly so they can be added to `requirements-dev.in` and compiled using `pip-tools` into `requirements-dev.txt` (respect `requirements.in` as the base constraint file).
- **Style Consistency**: Do not introduce styles that conflict with `pyproject.toml`.
