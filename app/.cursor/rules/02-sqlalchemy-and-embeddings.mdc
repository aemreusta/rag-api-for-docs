# SQLAlchemy & Embeddings Rules

## 1. Database Operations

- **Model Definitions**: When defining ORM models in `db/models.py`, use `Mapped` and `mapped_column` for fully type-hinted models.
- **Session Management**: Database sessions should be injected as dependencies and properly managed.
- **Querying**: Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 `select()` syntax for all queries. Do not use raw SQL unless absolutely necessary.
- **Alembic Migrations**: If you change an ORM model, state that a new Alembic migration script must be generated.

- **Typing**: Use `Mapped[T]`, `mapped_column`, and explicit `Relationship` typing. Avoid untyped attributes.

## 2. Embeddings & Vector Search

- **Vector Operations**: When working with embeddings, ensure proper handling of vector similarity search.
- **Content Processing**: Maintain consistency in how text content is processed and embedded.
- **Query Engine**: The `core/query_engine.py` should handle the orchestration of embedding generation and similarity search.
- **Performance**: Consider pagination and limits for large result sets from vector searches.

- **pgvector**: Ensure correct `vector` types and indexes as defined in alembic versions. Prefer HNSW indexes for high-recall queries where supported.

## 3. Content Management

- **Content Storage**: Ensure content embeddings are properly stored with metadata.
- **Chunk Management**: Handle text chunking consistently for optimal embedding performance.
- **Retrieval Patterns**: Implement efficient retrieval patterns for relevant content based on user queries.
